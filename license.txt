Disclaimer

Luma is provided “as is.”

While it can perform AI-driven actions on your PC, it is not guaranteed to be 100% accurate.

Luma now includes a full terminal log displaying each step taken by the AI, alongside a brief summary in the GUI, so both technical and non-technical users can monitor its actions.

Do not use Luma for sensitive or critical tasks (e.g., online banking, registry edits, confidential documents).

Machovotrish and CursorTouch are not liable for any damages resulting from use.

Always stay present when Luma is running. The console displays real-time actions. If unexpected behavior occurs, use the Stop button, close the console, or restart the app immediately. Closing the console immediately closes the app.
